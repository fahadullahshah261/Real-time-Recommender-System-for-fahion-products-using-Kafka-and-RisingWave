# Real-time Recommender System using RisingWave and Kafka
This project showcases RisingWave's application in recommender systems, including data transformation and preprocessing, data streaming using Kafka, and model training through Metaflow, Comet ML, and Merlin framework, visualizing recommendations with Streamlit.
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a real-world application of RisingWave, a distributed streaming platform, within the realm of recommender systems, in particular, and machine learning in general. It begins with a fashion-products recommendation company that tailors recommendations to its customers based on a rich dataset encompassing customersâ€™ information, product data, and transaction history. This real-time data is supposedly sourced directly from the company's platform and seamlessly streamed into Kafka, which serves as the streaming platform with various Kafka topics that stores all this data. 

Subsequently, all this data is sent to Risingwave Cloud platform where it undergoes rigorous transformations and feature engineering using SQL. Thus, all the preprocessing tasks are executed within the Risingwave Cloud environment. 
Metaflow is used to orchestrate and manage the machine learning workflows. Additionally, Comet ML provides support for tracking experiments across various recommender models based on different sets of hyperparameters, helping us to visualize the project's machine learning lifecycle.

The project leverages the Merlin framework from NVIDIA for data preparation and recommender model training. This powerful framework streamlines the whole process and ensures efficient model training. Once the recommender model has been trained, validated, and rigorously tested, Streamlit is employed to create a user interface, thus allowing us to visualize the recommendations generated by the recommender model.
